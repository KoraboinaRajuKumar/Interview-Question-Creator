https://docs.spring.io/spring-ai/reference/api/clients/openai-chat.html


The Spring AI project aims to streamline the development of applications that incorporate artificial intelligence functionality without unnecessary complexity.

ChatClient:
===========

The chatclient interface stremline interaction with AI-MODULE, it simplyfies connecting to various AI-MODULES each with potentially unique APIS, by offering uniform interface for interaction.


OpenAI Chat:
===========

Spring AI supports ChatGPT, the AI language model by OpenAI. ChatGPT has been instrumental in sparking interest in AI-driven text generation, thanks to its creation of industry-leading text generation models and embeddings.


what is AI ?
===========

Artificial intelligence (AI) is technology that enables computers and digital devices to learn, read, write, create and analyze.

Why AI ?
=======
Increased Efficiency: AI can automate repetitive tasks, improving efficiency and productivity in various industries. Data Analysis and Insights: AI algorithms can analyze large data quickly, providing valuable insights for decision-making.

Types of AI models:
===================
Deeplearning,decission making,super vector mechines,logistices......

what is NLP?
============
Natural language processing (NLP) is a branch of artificial intelligence (AI) that enables computers to comprehend, generate, and manipulate human language. Natural language processing has the ability to interrogate the data with natural language text or voice.



Amazon Bedrock:
===============
The easiest way to build nd scale generate AI applications with foundation models(FMs).


Amazon sagemaker:
================

Amazon SageMaker provides machine learning (ML) capabilities that are purpose-built for data scientists and developers to prepare, build, train, and deploy high-quality ML models efficiently.


LLAMAINDEX:
===========
LlamaIndex is a simple, flexible data framework for connecting
custom data sources to large language models.LlamaIndex provides the key tools to augment your LLM applications with data like data ingestion, data indexing and query interface

=>Llamaindex and langchain both are create end to end GEN-AI projects,


Diff B/W Llamaindex and langchain?

1).PrimaryFocus

intelligent to search and data indexing and retrival.
Buidling a wide range of Gen-AI applications.

2).Datahandling
   ingesting 	structreing and accesing private or domain specific data.
   Loading processing and indexing data for verious users,

3). Customizations
  integrating private data into LLMS.
  Highly customizable it allows users to chain multiple tools and componetns.

4).Programming language
   Both python based library.


Where use Llama index? Index technics
where use Langechain ? prompt technics



Boto3:
=====

The AWS SDK for Python (Boto3) provides a Python API for AWS infrastructure services. Using the SDK for Python, you can build applications on top of Amazon S3, Amazon EC2, Amazon DynamoDB,


LLM(Large language model):
=========================




==================================================================AI INTERVIEW QUESTIONS=================================================================

1).what is Generative AI And where is it used?
ANS: Generative AI refers to Deep learning modules,at can generate High quality text ,images and other content based on the data trained on.
It learns the underlying patterns and structure of the data with help of neural networks to genertate new and original content,

where is used:
=============
NLP
Content generation
Image and vedio generation.
Data generation and Analisis.
healthcare 
Finance.

2).How Generative AI works?
Generative AI modules use deep learning to Analyzecommon patterns and arrangement in large sets of data.
Than thay use this information to create new ,convincing outputs.
The modules do this incorporating machine learning techiniques knowns as Neural networks.

process->datacollection->traing->genaration->Finetuning.


3).Large Language Models?
  LLMs are foundational mechine learning models that use deep learning             
  algorithms to process and understand natural language.
  Thay understand complex textual data,identify entities and relationships b/w them.and generate new text.

4).name of few top GEN-AI modles?
GPT-4,BERT,DALL-E,STABLEDIFFUSION.

5).what is prompt engineering?
  It is interaction between a user and the AI model.
  prompts are a detailed description of desired output expected from the model.

6).Name four prompt engineering Techniques?
  ZERO_SHOT PROMPTING
  FEW-SHOT PROMPTING
  CHAIN-OF-THOUGHT PROMPTING
  SELF-CONSISTENCY PROMPTING

7).what are the limitations of Generation AI?
 BIASNESS,
 privacy Concerns,
 Spread misinformation,
 Legal and copyright matter,
 impact on psychology,
 Accountability,

DOUGHTS:
=======
when i was activating not able to show the env name
when i install the python from base pkg version isnot chmaged

issue with the file setup.py (setuptools libraray)
setup.py file all the details are mandatory?
all librarys imported or not where we need to check


model name where we need to find
